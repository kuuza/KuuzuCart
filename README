Welcome to Kuuzu!

We are ready to share our new foundation with you and are excited to create a
new, fast and simple open source cart.

The v1.0 beta will focus on a new framework API to start building onto. 
Until officially released, the software as is will not
to be able to run an online store, however the plan is to create a 
delivery mechanism that will easily upgrade running installations.

Be aware that before final release the updates may break your store.

We look forward to working with you in improving and extending Kuuzu!

To install Kuuzu v1.0 Beta, copy the contents of the release
package to your public html directory. The "Kuuzu" directory can be added
to the PHP include directory and be moved outside of the public html directory.

The Setup Site will first load to setup and configure a new installation. Once
installed and configured, the Shop and Admin Sites can be reached with:

index.php (for Shop)
index.php?Admin (for Admin)

Please note that the Setup Site is still reachable and should be deleted. This
can be performed by deleting the following directory:
